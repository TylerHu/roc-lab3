**Rails on Campus** is a program started by Leon Du and Shaokun Wu, 2 ruby developers in Guangzhou, China. 
The idea is to build a good set of material for introduction courses that can be used to teach Rails 
on college campuses. College students are often not exposed to the latest development techniques, 
and are left to learn on the job. The goal of this program is to introduce students to the world of 
open source development frameworks to help prepare them for a good job.

Rails on Campus是由中国广州两位Ruby 开发者， Leon Du和Shaokun Wu 发起的。活动的初衷是为大学Rails的
教学积淀一些有价值的学习材料。大学学生接触新技术的机会不十分多，而常常要上到工作岗位才开始学习。
希望通过这次活动，可以为同学们带来更多开源的开发框架，以此为将来的好工作更好地准备自己。
