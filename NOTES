First, show running miniblog app
Then:
$ rm -rf miniblog

why!!!
well, cause in about 10 min, I can have it back
 
$ rails new miniblog

$ rails server
 + look at dir structure, app dir, config dir, public dir
 + edit public/index
$ rails generate scaffold messages body:text
 + look at view, model, migration
$ rake db:migrate
 + creates DB
$ rails server
 + delete public/index.html, edit routes.rb
 + show scaffold

now, edit html: 
+ delete extra links (show,destroy,edit) from index
+ move new form to top of index
+ redirect to index after create
+ change table to ul, add a tiny bit of css so the list looks nice
+ add some css so the textfield isn't so ugly
+ add the timestamp to the list

edit controller:
 
 + show .xml .json
