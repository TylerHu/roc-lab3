Rails on Campus is a program started by Leon Du and Shaokun Wu, 2 ruby developers in Guangzhou China. The idea is to build a good set of material for introduction courses that can be used to teach Rails on college campuses. In particular in Guangzhou, college students are often not exposed to newer technology, and the goal of this program is to introduce students to a new world of open source development frameworks. Not just Rails, but also things like Node.js or Python/Django.
